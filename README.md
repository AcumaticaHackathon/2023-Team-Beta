# 2023-Team-Beta
This is the repository for Team Beta's Hackathon project that was held on January 28th & 29th at the 2023 Summit at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The B2Bot Beta AI framework allows the Acumatica system to analyze Natural Language Processing information from emails managed within the email system. The analysis results are processed through an NLP processing interface that can then perform updates to the Acumatica system based on the results. One use case we use as an example of is to process correspondence regarding Purchase order updates initiated from the Acumatica business events system. The results of the mail from the vendor are then automated and entered into the Acumtiaca system if a determined confidence level is reached. Another use case is to gauge sentiment analysis of feedback sent on a support case. These results are then, in turn, fed into a business dashboard that shows Key Performance indicators. At the heart of the project is an extensible system that can be used to handle other use cases. We have allowed for an Interface that can be used to further process results to address and solve a variety of business problems.
